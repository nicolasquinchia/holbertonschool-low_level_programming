# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.

## What is a data structure?

Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy). Just as you will likely select a spoon to eat a bowl of soup rather than a knife, you will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with.

## Example

Function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

First make the structure for the nodes.

```c
/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
	char *str;
	unsigned int len;
	struct list_s *next;
} list_t;

```
After that create a function that print the content of each node and count every node on a int variable

```c
#include "lists.h"
/**
 * print_list -  prints all the elements of a list_t list.
 * @h: Adress of the head of the linked list to print
 *
 * Return: Unsigned int with the number of nodes printed
 */
size_t print_list(const list_t *h)
{
	size_t j = 0;

	while (h != '\0')
	{
		if (h->str == '\0')
		{
			printf("[0] (nil)\n");
		}
		else
		{
			printf("[%u] %s\n", h->len, h->str);
		}
		j++;
		h = h->next;
	}
	return (j);
}

```
Finally create a main function calling the function to print and return the int value

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "lists.h"

/**
 * main - check the code for Holberton School students.
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
	list_t *head;
	list_t *new;
	list_t hello = {"World", 5, NULL};
	size_t n;

	head = &hello;
	new = malloc(sizeof(list_t));
	if (new == NULL)
	{
		printf("Error\n");
		return (1);
	}
	new->str = strdup("Hello");
	new->len = 5;
	new->next = head;
	head = new;
	n = print_list(head);
	printf("-> %lu elements\n", n);

	printf("\n");
	free(new->str);
	new->str = NULL;
	n = print_list(head);
	printf("-> %lu elements\n", n);

	free(new);
	return (0);
}

```

### Output

```bash
[5] Hello
[5] World
-> 2 elements

[0] (nil)
[5] World
-> 2 elements
```
